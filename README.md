Proposed bylaws for the Washington Cannabis Integrators Alliance.

## Proposed Bylaws

Over the Fall season of 2021, the members of the Washington Cannabis Integrators
Alliance (WCIA) have grown their organization into an active, communicative, and
most importantly cooperative group that rapidly problem solves industry technical
problems. Over a period of several months, the group has achieved an Interoperability
model being actively deployed across the industry. The group continues to grow and 
achieve, and it may benefit from greater organizational structure. A common 
organizational tool for providing such structure are Bylaws. For consideration of
the group, I present a proposed bylaws document for review.
